# Lantrix DotFiles

These are the Unix configurations I'm using.
Currently Mac OSX and Bash orientated.

## Usage

This is a repo (Castle) compatible with the [homesick gem](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).
Assuming you already have installed homesick, and don't have an existing `$HOME/.bash_profile` etc.

    cd ~
    homesick clone lantrix/dotfiles
    homesick symlink dotfiles
