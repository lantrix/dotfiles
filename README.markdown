# Lantrix DotFiles v2

These are the Unix configurations I'm using.
Currently MacOS and Bash orientated, supporting Linux.

## Usage

This is a repo (Castle) compatible with the [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick). Assuming you already have installed homeshick:

```shell
cd ~
homeshick clone lantrix/dotfiles
homeshick symlink dotfiles
```
